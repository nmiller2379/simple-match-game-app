## Functional Requirements

1. **View Card Grid**
   - As a user, I want to see a grid of cards so that I can interact with the game.

2. **Flip Cards**
   - As a user, I want to click on a card to flip it over and see its hidden side.

3. **Match Cards**
   - As a user, I want the game to check if two flipped cards are a match so that I can know if I have found a pair.

4. **Track Progress**
   - As a user, I want the game to track and show the number of successful matches out of the number of possible matches so that I know my progress.

5. **Reset Game**
   - As a user, I want to be able to reset the game at any time so that I can start over.

6. **Game Timer**
   - As a user, I want to see a timer that shows how long I've been playing the current game so that I can track the time.

7. **End Game**
   - As a user, when all matches are found, I want the game to show a completion message and the total time taken to play so that I know I have finished.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Responsive Design**
   - As a user, I want the game interface to be usable on both desktop and mobile devices.

2. **Performance**
   - As a developer, I want the game to perform efficiently without any lag when flipping cards or starting a new game.
